## Machine Learning Project: Workflow

Business Problem: the house prices in the US are expensive. The purpose of this project is to predict the best price for each houses
based on its characteristics. 

### Analytical Approach: 
- analyse the dataset
- exploring features of the dataset
- model training and evaluating
- visualise the best house prices aligning with each feature 

### Data Collection: 
- Kaggle Dataset: American House Prices https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/jeremylarcher/american-house-prices-and-demographics-of-top-cities/data 
- ChatGPT

ML/DS Workflow
+ Data Preprocessing
+ Exploratory Data Analysis
+ Feature Engineering
+ Feature Selection + Correlation Analysis

+ Model Building
+ Model Training
+ Hypertuning Parameters
+ Model Evaluation
+ Linear Regression: Single + Multiple linear regression
+ Cost Function for House price: Gradient Descent

### Data Understanding
1 Row: the house that is for sale
2 Column: the feature that qualifies the house

for example at rowindex 2: context
house 2 located in 140 CHARLES ST APT 4D in the city of New York (State NY) with a price of $1,650,000.0. It has 1 bedroom and a bathroom with a living space of 
718 ft2 (later in m2) 

## Feature Engineering

Feature                         -     Description

Price                                 reduce 10**3 to 1k    
Household income                      reduce to 1k          900 203 --> 900.02k dollar
Living Space                          convert to m2
Zip code population                   reduce to 1k

Possible Features
zip code Population/living Space
Price/bedroom
Price/bathroom

## Exploratory Data Analysis
+ Plot distrbution graph for categorical and numerical variable
+ Possible correlation

Price <-> Population
